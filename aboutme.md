title: About me
subtitle: Why you should hire me!
---

I am a Computational and Data scientist. I got a PhD (Dr. rer. nat.) in Theoretical Chemistry at TU Darmstadt, Germany in 2018. I have Bachelors (IIT Roorkee, India) and Masters (Universty at Buffalo, USA) in Chemical Engineering.

Learning new things excites me more than anything. I am currently, exploring various Machine learning and deep learning algorithms using scikit-learn, Tensorflow and fastati libraries. Also, I am taking a stab at big data analytics using Hadoop and SQL. I will dedicate my posts to topics related to the above areas.

Apart from that, I like reading, horse-riding, movies and progromming among other things. Once, I find time, I will spend time on writing short-stories to show-case one of other talents, humor.
